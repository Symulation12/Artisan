### Artisan - Overview 

</div>

Before you get started with Artisan, we should go over a few things about how the plugin works. Artisan is simple to use once you understand a few key factors.

<div align="center"> 

### Crafting Modes

</div>

Artisan features an "Automatic Action Execution Mode" which merely takes the suggestions provided to it and performs the action on your behalf. 
By default, this will fire as fast as the game allows, which is faster than normal macros.
You are not bypassing any sort of game restrictions doing this, however you can set a delay should you choose to.
Enabling this has nothing to do with the suggestion making process Artisan uses by default.

</div>

If you do not have the automatic mode enabled, you will have access to 2 more modes. "Semi-Manual Mode" and "Full Manual".
"Semi-Manual Mode" will appear in a small pop-up window when you start crafting.

</div>

By clicking the "Execute recommended action" button, you are instructing the plugin to perform the suggestion it has recommended.
This considered semi-manual as you still have to click each action, but you don't have to worry about finding them on your hotbars.
"Full-Manual"" mode is performed by pressing the buttons on your hotbar as normal.
You are provided with an aid by default as Artisan will highlight the action on your hotbar if it is slotted. (This can be disabled in the settings)

### Solvers/Macros

</div>

Artisan by default will provide you with suggestions on what your next crafting step should be. This solver is not perfect however and it is definitely not a substitute for having appropriate gear. 
You do not need to do anything to enable this behaviour other than have Artisan enabled. 

If you are trying to tackle a craft that the default solver cannot craft, Artisan allows you to build macros which can be used as the suggestions instead of the default solver.
Artisan macros have the benefit of not being restricted in length, can fire off as fast as the game allows and also allows some additional options to tweak on the fly.

Once you have created a macro, you will have to assign it to a recipe. This is easily accomplished by using the Recipe Window dropdown. By default, this is attached to the top right of the in-game crafting log window but can be unattached in the settings.

<div align="center">

</div>

Select a macro you have created from the dropdown box. When you go to craft this item, the suggestions will be replaced by the contents of your macro.

### Endurance

</div>

Artisan has a mode titled "Endurance Mode" which is basically a fancier way of saying "Auto-repeat mode" which will continually try to craft the same item for you. 
Endurance Mode works by selecting a recipe from the in-game crafting log and enabling the feature.
Your character will then attempt to keep crafting that item as many times as you have materials for it.

The other features should hopefully be self-explanatory as Endurance Mode can also manage the usage of your food, potions, manuals, repairs and materia extraction between crafts.
The repair feature only supports repairing with dark matter and does not support repair NPCs.

<div align="center"> 

### Crafting Lists

</div>

Artisan also has the ability to create a list of items and have it start crafting each of them, one after another, automatically.
Crafting lists have a lot of powerful tools to streamline the process of going from materials to final products.
It also supports importing and exporting to Teamcraft.
